\begin{abstract}
 The goal of this project is to study the deformation of bridge truss design in a three-dimensional way considering elasticities. This study uses a hand created Mathematica code. The original design of the code was created by Dr. Humphrey H. Hardy while working at Piedmont College, and further developed by Dr. Michael Berglund and myself. We can then take the code and test our code by creating a balsa wood bride and test it ourselves. We will set up a video camera while the bridge is being tested to create a graphical design to compare to the model created in Mathematica. We may then calculate the total forces per each member in our model to understand how the weight is distributed throughout the truss.
